## Usage

 ## Supporting multiple format calling
	    t =  AvailableTime::TimeSlot.new(8.30,"5.30pm")
	    t =  AvailableTime::TimeSlot.new(8.30,"17.30")
	    t =  AvailableTime::TimeSlot.new(8.30,"17:30")
	    t =  AvailableTime::TimeSlot.new(8.30,"5:30pm")
	    appointments = [["09:00","9:30"],["10:01","11:30"],["14:00","16:30"],["13:01","13:30"]]
            t.free_slots(appointments)
	    result #=>  [["08:30 AM", "09:00 AM"], ["09:30 AM", "10:00 AM"], ["11:30 AM", "12:00 PM"], ["12:00 PM", "12:30 PM"], ["12:30 PM", "01:00 PM"], ["01:30 PM", "02:00 PM"], ["04:30 PM", "05:00 PM"], ["05:00 PM", "05:30 PM"]]
	  
 ## Supporting multile time format

	  appointments = [["09:00","9:30"],["10:01","11:30"],["14:00","16:30"],["1:01pm","1:30 Pm"],["12:30PM", "01:00PM"]]
	  appointments = [["09:00","9:30"],["10:01","11:30"],["14:00","16:30"],["1:01pm","1:30 Pm"],["12:30 PM", "01:00 PM"]]	
## Interval
      Defalut interval is 30 minutes, We can change it by passing 

      t =  TimeSlot.new(8.30,"5.30pm",:interval => 5.minutes)

## Rest
	  We can pass rest time as well 
	  Ex.
	  t =  TimeSlot.new(8.30,"5.30pm",:rest => 5.minutes)
	  So result will generate like 5 mins rest time

 	  [["08:30 AM", "09:00 AM"], ["09:05 AM", "09:35 AM"], ["09:40 AM", "10:10 AM"], ["10:15 AM", "10:45 AM"], ["11:35 AM", "12:05 PM"], ["12:10 PM", "12:40 PM"], ["12:45 PM", "01:15 PM"], ["01:20 PM", "01:50 PM"], ["01:55 PM", "02:25 PM"], ["02:30 PM", "03:00 PM"], ["03:35 PM", "04:05 PM"], ["04:10 PM", "04:40 PM"], ["04:45 PM", "05:15 PM"]]
